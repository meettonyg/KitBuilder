# Media Kit Builder - Architecture Improvements

## Overview of Changes

This document outlines the architectural improvements made to the Media Kit Builder plugin to eliminate the need for patch files and fix issues at their root level.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Centralized Script Loading
- All scripts are now loaded from `includes/enqueue-scripts.php`
- Proper dependencies are maintained
- React is loaded before dependent scripts
- No more hardcoded script tags in templates

### 2. Unified AJAX Handlers
- All AJAX operations are now handled in `includes/class-ajax-handlers.php`
- Consistent error handling
- Improved security with proper nonce verification
- Centralized data validation

### 3. Event Delegation for Dynamic Elements
- Premium component access control uses event delegation
- Template selection uses event delegation
- All dynamically added elements now work correctly
- No more need for specialized handlers for dynamic content

### 4. API URL Improvements
- Template API now uses relative URLs
- Proper REST API authentication
- Error handling with fallbacks
- Improved cross-domain compatibility

## Removed Patch Files

The following patch files have been removed as their functionality has been properly implemented in core files:

3. Premium component access tests
4. Template system tests
5. Integration tests
