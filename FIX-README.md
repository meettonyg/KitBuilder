# Media Kit Builder Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **External Polyfill Loading Error**
   - Created a local polyfill.min.js file in assets/js/lib/
   - Updated class-url-router.php to load the local polyfill instead of external one

2. **Syntax Error in builder-wordpress.js**
   - Fixed code indentation and formatting issues
   - Corrected function structure in WordPress adapter fallback

3. **Duplicate Class Declarations**
   - Added class existence check to prevent redeclaration of classes
   - Renamed TemplateManager to SectionTemplateManager
   - Fixed all references to maintain compatibility

4. **Initialization Error in standalone-initializer.js**
   - Added error handling for initialization queue
   - Fixed error with forEach on undefined

## Usage Instructions

1. The fixes are applied directly to the codebase
2. No additional configuration is needed
3. The media kit builder should now work properly without console errors

## Potential Future Improvements

1. Implement better error handling throughout the codebase
2. Add a more comprehensive local polyfill for better compatibility
3. Improve code structure to avoid circular dependencies
4. Implement more robust class initialization checks
